Build a calculator in React in ~90 minutes

No CSS, or very minimal for functional reasons
1. Create the buttons in HTML/JSX
2. Link them up with an input box that will actually have the math-correct inputs (Eg. 5\*8)
3. Have an enter button that will actually perform and output the result
4. Display result

* Numbers: 0-9
* Operations: / * + -
* Clear Button
* Enter = button
* Decimal Button
